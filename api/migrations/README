## Aggregate Materialized Views

We use aggregate materialized views named `h3_data_resN`containing the dataset count per h3 tile where `N` is the h3 resolution ranging from 1 to 8.
```
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW h3_data_resN;
```
needs to be ran upon indexing new datasets or periodically to make sure the web map displays an accurate count of datasets.
