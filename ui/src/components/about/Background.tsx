          Geospatial data has proven invaluable for providing localized information crucial to various development and economic research initiatives. These research activities are essential as they ultimately guide policymaking to address a multitude of socio-economic issues effectively. However, a significant challenge limiting the extensive use and reuse of geospatial data is the fragmentation and siloing of data across disparate data sources. This fragmentation creates a substantial hurdle, impeding the efficient utilization of geospatial data for research and other practical applications.

          One of the main issues researchers face is the tremendous overhead involved in stocktaking available data for a specific geography. This process slows down both the scoping and initiation phases of research. Often, researchers might rely on previously utilized data, leading to the same datasets being repeatedly used in successive studies despite more relevant yet less popular data being available elsewhere. Additionally, data usage is frequently influenced by &quot;social networks,&quot; wherein researchers use data previously used by their peers or acquaintances. This reliance on familiar datasets means that some potentially more appropriate and recent data remain underutilized simply because they are not easily discoverable, less popular, or new.

          The WorldEx project aims to address these limitations, enabling use cases primarily around data stocktaking for subnational data. WorldEx comprises a comprehensive library and an innovative application designed to host information regarding the availability of geospatial data at both national and subnational levels. By consolidating geospatial data from various sources into a unified and accessible platform, WorldEx seeks to mitigate the issues of data fragmentation and siloing.

          WorldEx offers a streamlined approach to data discovery, enabling researchers to efficiently locate and utilize the most relevant and up-to-date geospatial data. This initiative not only facilitates the research process but also ensures that analysts who inform policymakers have access to the best available data, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of socioeconomic policies and interventions.
