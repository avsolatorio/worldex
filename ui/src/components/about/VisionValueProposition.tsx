        Vision and Value Proposition

        <p>
          Our vision for WorldEx is to become a catalog of socio-economic geospatial data, significantly accelerating the process of geospatial data stocktaking.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of WorldExâ€™s key value propositions is its unique approach to data management. WorldEx does not host any geospatial data directly. Instead, the application functions as a gateway, enabling users to seamlessly navigate and access various data catalogs containing the actual geospatial datasets. This distinctive feature is particularly advantageous for data catalogs that require users to request permission before accessing data. By not hosting data, WorldEx eliminates the need for cumbersome data duplication and storage, focusing instead on enhancing data discoverability and accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, WorldEx serves as a bridge that connects disparate geospatial data silos, providing users with a comprehensive and unified view of data availability across different geospatial levels. This holistic perspective empowers users to make more informed decisions, fostering greater efficiency and effectiveness in finding data for their research and analyses for policy-making efforts.
