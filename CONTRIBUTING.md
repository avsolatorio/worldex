# Contributing Guidelines
_(This is a work in progress)_

1. Open an issue to discuss intended changes or additions to the codebase
2. When making a pull request, first fork the repo and branch off from `main`
3. Limit the scope of your pull request, ideally addressing a single issue or adding only a single feature
4. Run the code linters on your pull request to minimize nitpicks during code review
